# Dungeon Crawler
## Overview

  Our project, "Infinicrawler", is our own take on the classic roguelite. The game has an endless amount of randomly generated floor layouts. All enemies, traps, and riddles are also randomly generated. It's structured in a way so that the game gets harder the further you go down. The goal of the game is to get as much gold as possible to beat your previous score.
